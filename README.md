# stm32h743
Peripheral access API for STM32H743ZI microcontroller (generated using svd2rust)

Documentation can be built with the following command if you git clone the repository:

    xargo doc --lib --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf

It should be possible to build or document this module with cargo, but I have not yet been able to get that to work.
